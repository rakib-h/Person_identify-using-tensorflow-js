# Person identify using Deep Learning, Tensorflow-JS
TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript Library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js. I complete a project as a assignment of Coursera  [TensorFlow: Data and Deployment Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment), course-1,[Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js](https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow) week-4.
